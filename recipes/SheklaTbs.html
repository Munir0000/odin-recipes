    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shekla Tibs is a traditional Ethiopian dish made from succulent pieces of meat (often beef or lamb) sautéed with
        onions, tomatoes, and a blend of spices. It is typically served in a clay dish that keeps the food warm, and
        it’s
        often enjoyed with injera, a spongy flatbread.</p>
