    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chechebsa, also known as kita firfir, is a traditional Ethiopian breakfast dish made from pieces of flatbread
        (kita)
        that are pan-fried with spiced butter (niter kibbeh) and berbere spice. It's a flavorful and hearty meal that is
        typically enjoyed with honey and yogurt on the side.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup water (adjust as needed)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon berbere spice mix</li>
        <li>Honey, for serving (optional)</li>
        <li>Yogurt, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Gradually add water and knead to form a smooth, pliable dough.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough into smaller portions and roll each portion into a thin flatbread (kita).</li>
        <li>Heat a dry skillet over medium heat and cook each flatbread for 2-3 minutes on each side, until lightly
            browned
            and cooked through. Remove from the skillet and let them cool slightly.</li>
        <li>Cut the flatbreads into bite-sized pieces.</li>
        <li>In the same skillet, melt the niter kibbeh over medium heat. Add the berbere spice mix and stir to combine.
        </li>
        <li>Add the pieces of flatbread to the skillet and toss to coat them evenly with the spiced butter.</li>
        <li>Cook for a few more minutes, stirring occasionally, until the flatbread pieces are crispy and well-coated
            with
            the spice mixture.</li>
        <li>Serve hot, optionally with honey and yogurt on the side.</li>
    </ol>
